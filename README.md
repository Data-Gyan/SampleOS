# SampleOS
SampleOS id a sample open source project. 
Following are the primary objectives of this repository :

1. Have proper Open-Source project structure in place
2. It can be a starting point to pickup as a template for a demo project
3. It's a public repository with MIT license


Product Description:

    This product is a POC used to analyze and develop insight into the data acquired from various sensors deployed in the field.
    With sensors we get time-series data stream, which is further analyzed, data cleaned, tranformations applied and machine learmning models are developed to understand which model best describe the sensor's behaqviour.

    Future fault tolerance, sensor maintenance requirement and reliability of the system is predicted in probailistic manner.
